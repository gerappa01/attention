  "literacy_help": "Becoming more literate sharpens my ability to think clearly, articulate ideas precisely, and resist shallow distraction. It gives me the mental discipline needed to run a company, the expressive range to write poetry or music that resonates, and the attention span to engage in meaningful conversation. Reading is how I train my mind, each page improves my judgment, my self-awareness, and my ability to synthesize knowledge across fields. It's not about collecting quotes; it's about developing a mind that can build, connect, and interpret with depth."
