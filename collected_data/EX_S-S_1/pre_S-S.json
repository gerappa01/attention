In my career, I aim to work as a corporate lawyer at MVM, with the possibility of starting my own company, and to grow a music production business that authentically expresses my creative voice. Personally, I seek meaningful relationships, marriage, and fatherhood, embracing the role of pater familias. I also have a deep desire to travel, reconnect with my childhood experiences, and immerse myself in diverse cultures particularly in places like Australia and remote islands to witness the world in its raw, natural beauty.",
  "literacy_help": "I want to gather first-hand, authentic knowledge to deepen my theological and professional understanding; Reading more would help me confront my doubts and build a solid foundation through scientific and philosophical theories; I recognize that even books I disagree with could broaden my worldview in the long run; I'd like to speak meaningfully about serious topics, especially with my wife, instead of staying on the surface; I have a deep interest in history, biographies, and historical novels I just need the motivation to read them; I want to live up to the literary example set by my parents and become as well-read as my brother."
