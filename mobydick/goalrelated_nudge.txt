This chapter brings me one step closer to actually founding my own company.
If I read it through now, my piano playing will be better tomorrow. I don’t know why, but it works.
Every page shaves off a little bit of mediocrity.
If I get distracted now, I’ll be neither an AI developer nor a poet. One page is enough. Now.
I’m not doing this for my teacher. I’m reading for myself. What’s at stake is who I’ll be tomorrow.
One sentence here shapes me more than ten workouts.
If I learn to focus on a single paragraph, maybe I’ll learn to focus better on a person too.
One day, someone will ask: “How do you know this?” And I want to know what to say.
I want to organize my thoughts. This page is a shelf in my mind.
This isn’t an escape from the world. It’s a return to myself.
If I don’t read now, I’ll just end up scrolling videos again tonight. And that won’t become a book.
Every page I read is a step toward my own book.
I won’t fall in love over a like. But one sentence might hit home.

This becomes that inner calm no one can take away.
I don’t read to be cool. I read so I’m not an idiot.
My muscles grow in the gym, my mind grows here.
This is a strategic decision. Not enjoyable, but important. Like waking up early.
You don’t always need motivation. Sometimes you just need to make it to the end of the sentence.
Reading means: I don’t react immediately. I interpret first.
